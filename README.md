# Job Recommender

## Project Description
The Job Recommender is a Python-based application that scrapes job listings from LinkedIn and provides personalized job recommendations. It uses Playwright for browser automation to authenticate and scrape jobs, stores job data locally, and optionally serves recommendations via a Streamlit web app.
